# Read Before It Explodes
- The objective of this project is to build a chat with real time and persistent conversation, to demonstrate fullstack skills, mainly with the tools: React Js, Node.js, WebSockets, Postgres/MongoDB. But unlike a conventional chat, the user when sending a message will set a time for this message to be read after being opened, so the conversation partner will have this time to read, after he has opened the message.
